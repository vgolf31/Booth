Common Questions:
Q: Why is the list information not showing up?
A: The app is hardcoded with a delay to update the information. It should only take around 5 seconds. 
If it takes longer than this, try switching between lists or tapping one of the items on the lists.
Q: The stocks these lists recommend are not good. Are these lists accurate?
A: The app uses the formula given by Joel Greenblatt. Sometimes, these stocks have some exterior reason for being the top of the list. 
The user is recommended to use their own intuition with their money.
Q: Where can I find more information on how to use these stocks?
A: Click on the yellow question mark icon on the top left of the app. It gives more information on how to use the stock values.
